\description{
Each row in this table is a member of one of the lists in the \code{list}
table. The data in this table stem from the information you can find on the
user's profile page. It is current as of this package's most recent update.
Therefore, the user's description, verified status, etc., may differ today.
You can join the user information in this table with rows in the \code{list}
and \code{tweet} tables via the \code{list_id} and \code{user_id} variables,
respectively.
